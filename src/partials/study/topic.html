            Observing the interaction of atoms with various forms of radiant, or
            transmitted, energy, such as the energy associated with visible
            light that we detect with our eyes, infrared radiation that we feel
            as heat, ultraviolet light that causes sunburn, and x-rays that
            produce images of our teeth or bones, scientists discovered much of
            what we know about the structure of the atom. You should be familiar
            with all of these types of radiant energy. We begin our explanation
            of how our current atomic model came to be by outlining the
            properties of waves and the particle nature of electromagnetic
            radiation. Light as a Wave Light is a transverse electromagnetic
            wave that the average person can see. Experiments on diffraction and
            interference were the first to demonstrate the wave character of
            light. Light, like other electromagnetic waves, can traverse a
            vacuum. Polarisation can be used to highlight the transverse
            character of light. Light, according to Christian Huygens, travels
            in waves. Huygens was a contemporary of Isaac Newton. However, Isaac
            Newton believed that light was made up of particles too tiny to be
            detected individually. Thomas Young, an English physicist,
            experimented in 1801 that demonstrated that light acts like a wave.
            He used two thin, parallel slits to pass a light beam through.

            When a ray of light approaches a smooth polished surface and the
            light ray bounces back, it is called the reflection of light. The
            incident light ray that land on the surface is reflected off the
            surface. The ray that bounces back is called the reflected ray. If a
            perpendicular were drawn on a reflecting surface, it would be called
            normal. The figure below shows the reflection of an incident beam on
            a plane mirror. Here, the angle of incidence and angle of reflection
            are with respect to normal and the reflective surface.

            Refraction is an important term used in the Ray Optics branch of
            Physics. Refraction of light is defined as the change in direction
            or the bending of a wave passing from one medium to another due to
            the change in speed of the wave. Some natural phenomena occurring in
            nature where refraction of light takes place are the twinkling of
            stars, the formation of mirages and Rainbows, Optical illusions, and
            many more. The major cause of refraction to occur is the change in
            the speed of waves in different mediums, which is different due to
            the difference between the densities of the mediums. e.g. the speed
            of light in a vacuum is maximum. Snell’s Law provides a quantitative
            description of the amount of bending of a wave, that depends on the
            refractive index of the two mediums. Let’s learn more about
            refraction like the Laws of Refractions, Causes of Refraction, Types
            of Refraction, Examples, and Applications of Refractions in the
            article below.

            Optics is a branch of Physics – it’s the science that deals with
            light. Optics explains how light energy behaves and interacts with
            matter. Some of the earliest recorded experiments in optics were
            done by ancient Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and Greeks using glass
            lenses and reflective materials like obsidian. During the Middle
            Ages and Enlightenment periods, the significant work of scientists
            Ibn al-Haythem (Book of Optics c1011) and Sir Isaac Newton (Opticks,
            1704) made contributions to the field of optics with their
            observations of the visible spectrum and how light moves through
            different substances, as mentioned in Chapter 1.1 History of colour
            theories. Other significant developments, such as Galileo’s
            refracting telescope (c.1609), also had a great impact on the fields
            of optics and astronomy. Since that time, many technological
            developments have expanded the field of optics to include both the
            visible and non-visible spectrum.
